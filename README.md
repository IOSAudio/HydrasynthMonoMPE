Use to route midi from an MPE controller to a Hydrasynth to fix a few bugs with mono patches and add a proper mono/last mode.

Existing Hydrasynth Bugs for mono patches with MPE turned on:

1. Playing the same note more than once and releaseing one of them also stops the other note.
2. Holding a note and then bending another note and releaseing changes the pitch of the original note.
3. Pitchbend on notes not playing effects playing notes, PB from all notes fight against each other.


The Hydrasynth Mono mode also high note priority when you release a key, I have added a Last note priority mode.
